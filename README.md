Hi there! 👋 I'm Vitalii

## 🔬 About Me
 - 🎓 I graduated with honors with a Bachelor's in Computer Science. My thesis focused on developing an information system using machine learning to predict agricultural crop yields.
 - 🌱 I’m currently learning .Net.
 - 🌐 Recently, I started working on AgroAI, a web application designed for farmers. This tool leverages machine learning to predict crop yields, monitor weather, manage resources, and identify risks like plant diseases.
 - 🌟 I'm interested in multi-criteria decision-making and optimization algorithms such as AHP, ELECTRE, and Firefly Algorithms.

## 🛠 My Technical Skills

- **Languages:** C#, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** React, React Bootstrap, Spectre.Console
- **Machine Learning & Data Science:** Neural Networks, Multi-Criteria Optimization, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), Firefly Algorithms
- **Tools:** Git, Javadoc, Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA
- **Database Management:** SQL, NoSQL

## 💡 Interests & Learning Goals

- 🌍 Applying innovative information technologies to **sustainable farming** and **smart agriculture**
- 📈 Enhancing decision-support systems for **multi-criteria optimization** problems, such as optimal job location selection and farming-related decisions
- 📚 Improving my skills in **frontend development**

## 📫 Get In Touch!

I’m always excited to connect with like-minded individuals and professionals. If you're interested in **collaborating on a project** or just want to say hello, feel free to reach out!
